# I have already published a Research Paper titled as "Enabling Machines to predict Customer Behavior using Voting-Classifier Technique" in Scopus Indexed Journal IJAST(International Journal of Advanced Science and Technology) for the same as my Final Year Project.

###  Data Source
The dataset that we have used for the study is a transnational dataset consisting of all transactions that had occurred       for the duration of 1 year i.e. between 1/12/2010 and 9/12/2011. The dataset is sourced from UK-based online (non-store)   retail. The firm primarily sells all occasion gifts. 
   

### Business Problem that had been solved:

#### Problem statement: The goal is to come up with a solution for the given questions:

    1. Can we categorize the customers in a particular segment based on their buying patterns? (Customer Segmentation)

    2. Can we predict which kind of items they will buy in future based on their segmentation? (Prediction)

#### ML Problem Mapping:

    1. Given a dataset of transanctions get the segments i.e clusters/segments. (Find common patterns and group them)
    2. Predict what to display to what group of users

#### Input: We will be using e-commerce data that contains the list of purchases in 1 year for 4,000 customers.

#### Output: The first goal is that we need to categorize our consumer base into appropriate customer segments. The second goal is we need to predict the purchases for the current year and the next year based on the customers' first purchase.
