### Data Source
   The dataset that we have used for the study is a transnational dataset consisting of all transactions that had occurred for      the duration of 1 year i.e. between 1/12/2010 and 9/12/2011. The dataset is sourced from UK-based online (non-store) retail. The firm primarily sells all occasion gifts.
